Implement usernames by sending username after ID in message

@ addressing for direct message

Handle multiple users attempting to start server

Multiple servers with port command line argument

Create random number handshake as a passcode for server signals like shutdown when sent to a client. Checked in parse()













Upgrading to web based:

Step 1: Refactor your Python code to Flask + Flask-SocketIO

    Convert your current terminal socket server to a Flask app.

    Use Flask-SocketIO to handle real-time chat messaging via WebSockets.

    Use Flask’s templating (Jinja2) to serve an HTML page for the chat UI.

    Add JavaScript in that HTML page to connect via WebSocket to Flask-SocketIO backend.

Step 2: Prepare your project folder

    Put everything in one folder, e.g., chat-app/

    Basic structure:

    chat-app/
      ├── app.py          # Flask + Flask-SocketIO server
      ├── templates/
      │     └── index.html # Your chat page (HTML + JS)
      ├── static/
      │     └── chat.js    # JS code to connect to socket server
      └── requirements.txt # List Flask, Flask-SocketIO, etc.

Step 3: Write your Flask app (app.py)

    Set up Flask and Flask-SocketIO server

    Serve index.html on /

    Handle SocketIO events like connect, message, disconnect

    Broadcast messages to all clients connected

Step 4: Create your HTML + JS frontend

    Simple page with a chat window and input box

    JS connects to Flask-SocketIO backend using Socket.IO client library

    Handles sending messages and displaying incoming messages live

Step 5: Test locally

    Run app.py locally

    Open browser to http://localhost:5000

    Open multiple tabs or devices and test chat

Step 6: Prepare for deployment

    Add a requirements.txt with all dependencies (Flask, Flask-SocketIO, eventlet or gevent)

    Create a Procfile (if needed) for Render to run your app:

    web: gunicorn -k eventlet -w 1 app:app

    Make sure your app listens on 0.0.0.0 and port from environment variable PORT Render provides

Step 7: Create GitHub repo and push code

    Create GitHub repository

    Push your project folder with all files

Step 8: Set up Render.com

    Sign up for free on render.com

    Connect your GitHub account

    Create a New Web Service

    Choose your repo and the branch

    Set build command (usually pip install -r requirements.txt)

    Set start command (from Procfile or directly: gunicorn -k eventlet -w 1 app:app)

    Deploy!

Step 9: Visit your Render URL and test live

    Open the URL Render gives you

    Test chatting from multiple devices/browsers

Summary checklist

    Refactor socket server to Flask + Flask-SocketIO

    Create HTML + JS frontend served by Flask

    Test locally, debug

    Add requirements and Procfile

    Push to GitHub

    Deploy on Render via connected repo

    Done
